# 👋 Hey, I'm Jon (aka `jr-systems-eng`)

I'm a **Platform / Systems Engineer** focused on:

- **Linux at scale** (CentOS/Rocky)
- **Infrastructure automation** (Puppet, Terraform)
- **CI/CD pipelines** (Jenkins, Harness)
- **Containers & Kubernetes** (GKE, homelab clusters)

By day I help keep complex, distributed systems running smoothly.  
By night I'm usually in my **homelab**, automating *all the things* and experimenting with new tooling.

---

## 🔧 What I work on

- **Platform & infrastructure engineering**
  - Designing and automating server builds (Kickstart, Puppet, Terraform)
  - Managing fleets of Linux systems in production environments
  - Modernizing legacy stacks onto containers & Kubernetes

- **CI/CD & DevOps**
  - Building pipelines for build / test / deploy (Jenkins → Harness)
  - Working with container registries and artifact repos
  - Automating performance testing workflows (JMeter, GCP, GKE)

- **Homelab & networking**
  - Proxmox clusters, Pi-hole, Home Assistant
  - Network segmentation, VLANs, and service layout
  - Treating homelab as a mini production environment
